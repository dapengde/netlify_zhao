# A more complicated study

Demo: Rats on diets

A biologist  studies the weight gain of male lab rats on diets over a 4-week period. Three different diets are applied. The results are shown in Table [tab-rats].

Table [tab-rats]: Weight gain of male lab rats

| Diet 1 | Diet2 | Diet3 |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| 90     | 120   | 125   |
| 95     | 125   | 130   |
| 100    | 130   | 135   |

Do the diets have influence on the weight gain?

If we do the $t$-test between each two groups...

Table [tab-alpha]: The increasing number of samples and the probability that at least one of the $t$-tests results in a significant difference

| Number of Samples | Number of Tests | $P$  |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---- |
| 3                 | 3               | 0.14 |
| 4                 | 6               | 0.26 |
| 5                 | 10              | 0.40 |
| 6                 | 15              | 0.54 |
| 7                 | 21              | 0.66 |
| 8                 | 28              | 0.76 |
| 9                 | 36              | 0.84 |
| 10                | 45              | 0.90 |

Instead of $t$-test for testing the means, we test the variances. Remember [$F$-test](https://pzhao.org/teaching/env203-2020/w07/#testtwovariances)?

# One-way ANOVA

Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
: One of the most widely used statistical techniques. The test partitions the total variation present in a set of data into two or more components. Associated with each of these components is a specific source of variation, so that it is possible to ascertain the contributions of each of these sources to the total variation.

One-way ANOVA
: A test that concerns only one independent variable ($x$), which is called a factor and has multiple levels (settings, groups).



1. Hypotheses and question:
   - $H_0: \mu _1 = \mu _2 = \mu _3 = ... = \mu_k$
   - $H_1$: at least one mean is different from others
   - Reject $H_0$?
   
2. Collect data. Suppose we have $k$ samples. The $i$-th sample has $n_i$ observations. 

Table [tab-dataset]: A data set which has only one independent variable with of multiple levels

|      | Level 1      | Level 2      | Level 3     | ...  | Level $k$    |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ---- | ------------ |
|      | $x_{1,1}$    | $x_{2, 1}$   | $x_{3,1}$   | ...  | $x_{k,1}$    |
|      | $x_{1,2}$    | $x_{2,2}$    | $x_{3,2}$   | ...  | $x_{k,2}$    |
|      | $x_{1,3}$    | $x_{2, 3}$   | $x_{3,3}$   | ...  | $x_{k, 3}$   |
|      | .            | .            | .           | .    | .            |
|      | .            | $x_{2, n_2}$ | .           | .    | .            |
|      | .            |              | $x_{3,n_3}$ | .    | .            |
|      | $x_{1, n_1}$ |              |             | ...  | $x_{k, n_k}$ |
| Mean | $\bar x_1$   | $\bar x_2$   | $\bar x_3$  |      | $\bar x_k$   |


3. Calculate a test statistic: $F$-test.

   According to Table [tab-anova].

Table [tab-anova]: The Entries of One-Way ANOVA Table

| Source          | $df$           | $SS$                                                         | $MS$                        | $F$                     |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Within samples  | $df_W = N - k$ | $SS_W = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i}(x_{ij}-\bar x_i)^2$  | $MS_W = \frac{SS_W}{df_W}$   | $F = \frac{MS_B}{MS_W}$ |
| Between samples | $df_B = k - 1$ | $SS_B = \sum_{i = 1}^k n_i(\bar x_i - \bar x)^2$             | $MS_B = \frac {SS_B}{df_B}$ |                         |
| Total           | $df_T = N - 1$ | $SS_T = \sum_{i = 1}^k \sum _{j=1}^{n_i} (x_{ij}-\bar x) ^2$ | $MS_T = \frac{SS_T}{df_T}$ |                         |

$N$
: The total number of the observations. $N = \sum n_i$

$x_{ij}$
: The $j$-th observation in the $i$-th sample

$\bar x$
: Overall/grand mean of all the observations. $\bar x = \frac{\sum x_{ij}}{N}$

$MS$
:  Mean ~~of~~ square~~d deviation from the mean~~

$SS$
: Sum ~~of~~ square~~d deviation from the mean~~

$df$
: degrees of freedom

If $H_0$ is true, then any difference you see between the $k$ samples are due to chance, i.e. $MS_B = MS_T = MS_W$. ==> $F$-test.

From Table [tab-anova], we can get:

$$df_T = df_W+ df_B$$

$$SS_T = SS_W  + SS_B$$

which can be used for double-check.

# Understanding ANOVA

## The model

$$
x_{i j}=\mu+\tau_{j}+\epsilon_{i j} ; \quad i=1,2, \ldots, n_{j} ; \quad j=1,2, \ldots, k
$$

$\mu$ 
: The grand mean. The mean of all $k$ population means.

$\tau_{j}$
: The treatment effect. The difference between the mean of the *j*-th population and the grand mean ($\bar x_j - \mu$).

$\epsilon_{i j}$
: The error term. The amount by which an individual measurement differs from the mean of the population to which it belongs ($x_{ij} - \bar x_j$).


$H_{0}: \mu_{1}=\mu_{2}=\cdots=\mu_{k}$

$H_{A}:$ not all $\mu_{k}$ are equal

## Assumptions

- The $k$ sets of observed data constitute $k$ independent random samples from the respective populations.
- Each of the populations from which the samples come is normally distributed with mean $\mu_{j}$ and variance $\sigma_{j}^{2}$. 
- Each of the populations has the same variance. That is, $\sigma_{1}^{2}=\sigma_{2}^{2}=\cdots=\sigma_{k}^{2}=\sigma^{2},$ the common variance.
- The $\tau_{j}$ are unknown constants and $\sum \tau_{j}=0$ since the sum of all deviations of the $\mu_{j}$ from their mean, $\mu,$ is zero.
- The $\epsilon_{i j}$ have a mean of $0,$ since the mean of $x_{i j}$ is $\mu_{j}$
- The $\epsilon_{i j}$ have a variance equal to the variance of the $x_{i j},$ since the $\epsilon_{i j}$ and $x_{i j}$ differ only by a constant; that is, the error variance is equal to $\sigma^{2},$ the common variance specified in the assumption above.
- The $\epsilon_{i j}$ are normally (and independently) distributed.

## Estimating the statistics

The population variance $\sigma^{2}$ may be estimated in two ways:

- The first way uses the $S S W$: $\sigma ^2 = MS_W = \frac{SS_W}{df_W}$
- The second way uses the $S S B$: $\sigma ^2 = MS_B = \frac {SS_B}{df_B}$

We can compare the two estimates of the population variance using the variance ratio: $F_\mathrm {score} = MSB/MSW$. The numerator degrees of freedom is $k − 1$. The denominator degrees of freedom is $N - k$.

# Repeated measures

Just like paired $t$-test, sometimes we compare matched samples with ANOVA, which is called *repeated measures*, or *randomized blocks*, or *within subjects*.

Suppose we have $k$ samples. Each sample has $n$ observations. 



Table: A data set which has repeated measures with only one independent variable with of multiple levels

# Two-way ANOVA

Demo: Rats on diets

A biologist  studies the weight gain of lab rats dependently on diets and gender over a 4-week period. Three different diets are applied. The results are shown in Table [tab-rats2]. Do diet and gender have an effect on weight gain?

|        | Diet 1 | Diet2 | Diet3 |
| ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| Male   | 90     | 120   | 125   |
|        | 95     | 125   | 130   |

# Choose the hypothesis tests

- One-sample test: Test the difference between a population mean and a hypothesized value.
  - One-sample $z$ test
  - One-sample $t$ test
  
- Two-sample test:  Test the difference between two population means.
  - Two-sample $z$ test
  - Two-sample $t$ test
    - un-paired
      - equal variance: tests two sample means drawn independently, both of which have similar variances
      - unequal variance – tests two sample means drawn independently, both of which have different variances
    - Paired – tests the means of paired or dependent samples
  
- Multiple-sample test: Test the difference between more than two population means.

  - One-way ANOVA

    - un-matched
    - matched (repeated measures)

  - Two-way ANOVA

!!! note: Haematocrit measurements
    

    Water from three sources in Suzhou – Dushu Lake, Jinji Lake and control – were fed to Sprague-Dawley rats and the level of packed red blood cells after centrifugation (called the *haematocrit*) was measured after 48 hours. The results were as follows:
    
    - Control: 38, 40, 32, 36, 40, 40, 38, 40, 38, 40, 36, 40, 40, 35, 45
    - Dushu Lake: 56, 60, 50, 50, 50, 35, 40, 40, 55, 35
    - Jinji Lake: 40, 42, 38, 46, 36
    
    Are the haematocrit measurements the same for all water sources? Answer the question with the correct hypothesis test step by step.

!!! note: egg mass production
    
    A scientist manipulated the density of adults limpets within enclosures (6, 12 and 24 individuals per enclosure) during two seasons (winter-spring and summer-autumn) so as to investigate the effects of adult density and season on egg mass production. Three replicate enclosures per density/season combination were used, and both density and season were considered fixed factors. Use hypothesis test step-by-step to study if the adult density and the season have effect on egg mass production.
